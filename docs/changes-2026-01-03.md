# Changes - 2026-01-03

## Frontend gameplay updates

- Extended post-answer pause to roughly 3.2s before advancing, giving players more time to see feedback.
- Added correctness feedback with green check (correct) and red X (incorrect) during gameplay.
- After the final question, the game now redirects to a results page that lists each question with the player’s answer and correctness indicator (plus any explanation returned by the API).

## Correctness indicators (green check / red X)

- In gameplay, feedback renders a green check when `res.data.correct` is true and a red X when false; this is driven by the feedback state set after each answer and displayed under the choices (see client/src/pages/Game.tsx).
- On the results page, each answered question shows a green check if `a.correct` is true and a red X if false, alongside the chosen answer and any explanation returned by the API (see client/src/pages/Results.tsx).
